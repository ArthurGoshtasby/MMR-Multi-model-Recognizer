First, combine the datasets in the Datasets/Training directory to a file such as 'trainDataset'. Then, use this dataset as the training dataset to train each of the 4 models using the provided interface. Save the created models in this directory. Next, use the 'testDataset' created earlier to find the accuracy of each model. Finally, precede the name of a created model with 100xaccuracy (percent correct recognition). For example, if accuracy of a model is 0.81 and the model's name is 'modelname.h5', change model's name to '81_modelname.h5'. Recognition accuracy of each model is used in decision making when using two or more models to recognize objects (coins in our case) in an image or dataset.

When extracting coins in an image, the obtained coins represent a dataset that can be used to test a model's accuracy. On the other hand, the augmented coins obtained from the detected coins can be used to train a model. A training dataset contains 5 different orientations of a detected coin, while a test dataset contains the detected coins in their original orientations.
