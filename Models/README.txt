First, combine the datasets in the Datasets/Training directory to a file such as 'trainDataset'. Then, use this dataset as the training dataset to train each of the four models using the provided interface. Save the created models in the 'Models' directory. Next, use the 'testDataset' created similarly to find the accuracy of each model. Finally, precede the name of each created model by 100xaccuracy (percent correct recognition). For example, if the accuracy of a model is 0.81 and the model's name is 'modelname.h5', change the model's name to '81_modelname.h5'. Recognition accuracies of the models are used as weights to predict the labels of new objects (coins in our case) in an image or dataset.

After segmenting an image into coins, the coins can be saved as a dataset to test a model's accuracy. An augmented dataset containing coins obtained from different orientations of the detected coins and their labels can be created and used to train each model. From each image a test dataset and a training dataset are created. Note that the test dataset is much smaller than the training dataset. When combining the test datasets and training datasets into larger test and training datasets, make sure the two datasets do not overlap. That is, if the test dataset of an image is included in the larger test dataset, make sure the training dataset obtained from that image is not included in the larger training dataset.
